## Berkeley 2050 Vision materials

- Draft for August 1 6:30pm meeting City Hall, sixth floor.

Not all the images and tables are in this version, yet. In progress.

A link below goes to Ray Yep's draft of August 1, 2019. As content is added to Section 6 and 7, and revisions occur, I'll update.

Use the [Table of Contents][toc2]  in the left sidebar to navigate the chapters. Note the button at the top to open or close the sidebar that shows the chapters.

I put this into a JupyterBook, so that it would be easier to incorporate data science analytics and real-time visualizations.

Editorial suggestions and annotations are easier to share in the form of a published book than in Word documents or GoogleSheets. This book can run live Jupyter Notebooks, so the reader can pull in ever-changing data, and explore, analyze and visualize it in real-time.

The hope is to provide an open platform for the Berkeley community to freely explore data about our shared future.

### Here's Ray Yep's draft, from which I built this Berkley 2050 web site.

## I have added some links to supporting reading and data sources.

As an example, look at Paul Hawken, (Berkeley High School, 1962) for his down-to-the-Berkeley-refrigerator-level detail of infrastructure action to reverse global warming:
[Paul Hawken: _Drawdown_](https://www.drawdown.org/) and a set of his references: [Drawdown References](https://www.drawdown.org/references)
And note that our new financial suggestions could be added to Paul's book as tools for change.
