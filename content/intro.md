This link below goes to Ray Yep's draft, which has no content yet in Sections 6 and 7.

I put this into a JupyterBook, so that it would be easier to incorporate data science analytics.

Editorial suggestions and annotations are easier to share in the form of a published book than in Word documents or GoogleSheets. This book is capable of running Jupyter Notebooks, to pull in data, explore, analyze and visualize an ever-increasing amount of data. We hope to provide an open platform for all Berkeley to freely explore our shared future.
