## Berkeley 2050 Vision materials

- Draft for August 1 meeting: Note: moved from Redwood Room to 6th floor, City Hall.

Not all the images and tables are in this Version 0.1

This link below goes to Ray Yep's draft, which has no content yet in Sections 6 and 7.

Use the [Table of Contents](../../03toc/toc) to navigate the chapters.

I put this into a JupyterBook, so that it would be easier to incorporate data science analytics.

Editorial suggestions and annotations are easier to share in the form of a published book than in Word documents or GoogleSheets. This book is capable of running Jupyter Notebooks, to pull in data, explore, analyze and visualize an ever-increasing amount of data. We hope to provide an open platform for all Berkeley to freely explore our shared future.

## I have added a set of links to supporting reading and data sources.  As an example, see our Berkeley High graduate's fundamentally important summary of the infrastructure of climate change:
[Paul Hawken: _Drawdown_](https://www.drawdown.org/) and a set of his references: [Drawdown References](https://www.drawdown.org/references)
