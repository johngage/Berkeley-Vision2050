Executive Summary
=================

Section 1 The Vision 2050 Initiative
====================================

Vision 2050 is a citizen-led planning effort, convened by Mayor Jesse
Arreguin, to create a common vision to guide physical infrastructure
planning. The vision extends over 30 years to encourage long-term
planning that will begin to meet the serious challenges of the 21^st^
century--- including climate change, inequality, population changes and
aging infrastructure--- and improve the quality of life for the next
generation of Berkeley residents. Vision 2050 proposes to move beyond
business-as-usual to accelerate the building of climate-smart,
technologically advanced, integrated, and efficient infrastructure.

**What is Infrastructure?**
---------------------------

Miles of infrastructure work to keep our city functioning beneath our
feet, under our tires, and all around us as we go from home to school
and work, shop and eat in town, or just enjoy the company of neighbors.
Some parts of this critical infrastructure are controlled by the City of
Berkeley while other important components are controlled by our
partners---EBMUD, PG&E, AC Transit, BART and others. Figure 1 shows the
components above the ground, on the street surface and below ground. We
call this the public commons.

![](./images/media/image6.jpeg){width="3.2604166666666665in"
height="2.3493055555555555in"}Infrastructure on the surface is the most
familiar feature---streets, sidewalks and bikeways that support cars,
trucks, bikes and feet. On this streetscape, power and streetlight poles
support electric and communications hardware, while trees and plants
invite us to slow down and enjoy life, providing habitat for our wild
neighbors, and improving the air we breathe.

Beneath our feet is another extensive world of cables, pipes, tunnels
and vaults that we rarely think about until something breaks. This
infrastructure delivers water to our homes and businesses, brings
natural gas for heating and cooking, and takes away our sewage. It is
also part of the electric and communications grids and home to
Berkeley's underground BART system.

Table 1 shows the magnitude of Berkeley's infrastructure systems.

height="1.3125in"}**What is the Problem?**

Berkeley, along with much of the United States, is faced with
infrastructure that was built 80+ years ago. Many facilities in Berkeley
were built as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the
late 1930's. Those projects included Aquatic Park, the Berkeley yacht
harbor, Rose Garden, Civic Center, the Community Theater on the Berkeley
High campus, and many other facilities. The City's streets, storm
drains, sewers, and EBMUD's water lines are also of similar age, if not
older. The problem with aging infrastructure is that they are
susceptible to unplanned failure, cause service interruptions, cost more
to maintain and don't meet current requirements.

![](./images/media/image8.png){width="1.3125in"
height="1.4048611111111111in"}Our infrastructure systems are old, much
of it is at the end of its useful life. How we got to this situation is
also a problem. We have not planned for all of the needed repairs and
provided the necessary funding to keep the systems in good working
condition. We do not have a life cycle approach to managing our
infrastructure. As we rebuild, the infrastructure must change in
response to population changes, environmental demands and technology
innovations.

To meet these complex challenges, we need to transform our
infrastructure management to include:

-   ![](./images/media/image9.png){width="1.2972222222222223in"
    height="1.5520833333333333in"}A longer term view

-   New technologies and solutions to develop intelligent adaptable
    infrastructure

-   Inter-department and inter-disciplinary planning

-   Additional funding

**How Was This Report Developed?**

Mayor Arreguin announced in his 2017 State of the City address his
intention to develop Vision 2050 -- a long--term infrastructure plan to
create a City that is resilient and sustainable for future generations.
The initiative began in April 2018 and concluded in November 2019. A
task force was formed that included over 40 people from across our
community. The work was organized into four work groups -- quality of
life, environment, technology, and finance/management. Involving the
community was very important in the process and that involvement
included a series of information sessions in Fall 2018 and community
workshops in Summer 2019. Our community voiced their support for this
Plan with the passage of Measure R in the November 2018 election, which
asked our Berkeley voters the following:

*Shall the measure, advising the Mayor to engage citizens and experts in
the development of Vision 2050, a 30-year plan to identify and guide
implementation of climate-smart, technologically-advanced, integrated
and efficient infrastructure to support a safe, vibrant and resilient
future for Berkeley, be adopted?*

Our community's overwhelming response was "yes."

**Section 2**

Street Corner View of Berkeley in 2050
======================================

If you are standing on a street corner in Berkeley in 2050, what will
our city look like? Will our infrastructure adapt to make our lives more
productive and enjoyable or will we feel the stress of too much change?
The Vision 2050 task force attempted to transport ourselves to the
future and imagined a Berkeley in 2050.

**A Vision for Berkeley in 2050**

What might a typical day look like in Berkeley in 2050? Our cool wet and
warm dry seasons will give way to a much warmer and drier climate. With
neighborhoods and supporting infrastructure specific to its place, there
is no one vision of Berkeley in 2050. We chose to imagine a fall day to
create a hypothetical story of what Berkeley could feel like as we adapt
our infrastructure and ourselves to a different climate.

**A Fall Day in Berkeley in 2050**

*Hi, I'm Maria! It's already a warm morning as I cycle down the bike
path, calling out to neighbors who are walking their kids to school and
getting ready for work. I continue down the street, thankful for the
protected bike lanes and the pothole free streets. What a difference
Vision Zero has made to bike and pedestrian safety! I am on my way to
the South Berkeley co-op where my great aunt Lizzie lives. She's 85 but
still learning, so we are going to a habitat restoration workshop at the
updated Berkeley Marina.*

*My watch pings to let us know that the accessible shuttle, now
celebrating its 20^th^ year of electrified operation, will pick us up in
five minutes. After we board, I take a moment to check my phone and see
that my home's smart energy system correctly rotated our solar panels to
maximize their output and shaded the windows on the sunny south side.*

*When we arrive at the workshop, we learn that Berkeley High students
trained in many kinds of habitat restoration are running the workshop.
Aunt Lizzie is pleased to find out these services are now subsidized for
low-income city residents. She sets up an appointment to have two
experts come evaluate landscape opportunities at her co-op.*

*As we stroll down the waterfront, we see people coming and going from
the bustling ferry terminal. Aunt Lizzie stops for a moment to remember
what this area was like before Berkeley restored the wetlands to help
protect the waterfront from sea-level rise and storm surges. It's
thrilling to see the snowy egrets hunting in the restored,
climate-buffering wetlands.*

*On the way to lunch, we spot solar panels now producing a significant
portion of the city\'s power needs, and I particularly enjoy easy access
to the strong secure Wi-Fi now available throughout the city. I'm still
trying to convince Aunt Lizzie to get an Easy Access watch, but she
prefers the old method of text messages on her phone.*

*After lunch, I return home and see the Berkeley fire department hard at
work. They are inspecting homes in the neighborhood to be sure that
debris is cleared away from our houses and that we are doing everything
we can to prevent an urban wildland fire. It's the time of year that the
Diablo winds kick up. We are thankful for the Public Works Department
who has undergrounded the overhead wires on Ashby and other evacuation
routes. Aunt Lizzie takes a shuttle home to rest.*

*Hi, I'm Aunt Lizzie! The mid-afternoon heat is unbearable, so we
seniors limit our outdoor activity then. Not long ago, the Home Helpers
with an HCD grant, helped our co-op retrofit for this new climate -- put
white shingles on the roof, installed an attic fan, added insulation,
installed an evaporative air cooling system, and raised the building to
avoid the basement flooding. What a relief! And with all the new trees,
our home is now comfortable and we didn't have to move!*

*At around 4 pm my friend Annie knocks on the door -- time for our
outdoor concert at the plaza! Fortunately, the plaza has lots of benches
and tables in the shade or we certainly wouldn't be here! We pick our
favorite spot under a leafy oak tree and close to the Mist Maker and
watch children playing in the interactive fountain. It's all recycled
water, so we don't worry about wasting water in this perpetual drought.*

*After the concert, Annie and I cross the street to the nearby park for
our Tai Chi class. At the corner, we press the button for the "Extra
Time to Walk" light; it gives us plenty of time to cross the street and
we feel much safer. It's time for home and dinner, so we walk to the
shuttle stop in the soft down-glow of LED lights, mounted hip-level on
the pathway's stanchions. Life at 85 in 2050 is different from what we
expected, but enjoyable nonetheless. New rain gardens now prevent those
awful flooded intersections of 2020 and provide a little green oasis at
every other corner! Annie and I look forward to the days of cooling sea
breezes, but we feel so fortunate to live in Berkeley where 30 years ago
someone thought to plan ahead! Berkeley is still an amazing and charming
city.*

**Establishing Our Core Values**

Berkeley's deteriorating infrastructure requires allocating financial
resources and resident support to remedy it. Although improvement
opportunities exist, fixing infrastructure is expensive, is technical,
and it is often met with inconsistent responses from residents and
policymakers alike. The inadequate and inequitable repairs to
infrastructure make people reluctant to finance it because people in
poorer neighborhoods experience longer response to their infrastructures
needs. Vision 2050 focuses on developing a resilient infrastructure that
will not only withstand shocks, but also provides an opportunity to
develop socioeconomic resilience to bring about employment opportunities
to Berkeley residents, address issues of equity, and build a healthy
city with the end goal of improving the overall quality of life of
current and future residents.

**Connecting the Dots**

We have imagined a healthy and resilient city, with a booming local
economy and less segregated in the year 2050. The vision has shown us
how far we can go as a city. Climate resilience and hazard risks are
relevant to Berkeley, instead of coming together during a time of
disaster and crisis, it is better to unite in preparation before
disaster strikes. Vision 2050 is the opportunity we have as residents to
start a transformative change to help us adapt and cope with disasters
and its impacts in a practical manner. Moving forward, an equitable
approach to infrastructure should, every year, strengthen Berkeley's
equity and inclusion metrics through improvements in health equity that
address all social determinants of health.

Place matters. Residents continue to experience growing health
disparities across different neighborhoods. Life expectancy is not
balanced across the city, population continues to grow, increasing
demand for more and better infrastructure and services. Inequitable
trends can be reversed as more affordable housing, accessible economic
opportunities, and stronger tenant protections emerge in the city;
therefore, providing a more stable living situation to vulnerable
residents.

Repairing our infrastructure translates to establishing a local green
economy, primarily driven by renewable energy, sustainable capital
improvement projects, and responsible technology achievements. Getting
there will take a lot of work and a significant financial lift.
Financing a resilient Berkeley is a central question in our minds.
Fortunately, the city is in good financial shape and confidently can
prepare to take the step forward, allowing the city to formulate the
long-range infrastructure plan for the next thirty years. The
significant feature of Vision 2050 is planning for a more integrative
built environment through technology, protecting the environment, having
a sound financing structure to pay for the vision, and improving
residents' quality of life.

Vision 2050 will establish a sense of resilience, strengthen social
networks, maintain a sustainable physical structure, and improve the
quality of life for thousands of residents. Vision 2050 can help us
achieve significant physical outcomes, yet disparities in equity and
inclusion across income, race, ethnicity, ability, and gender has not
been resolved, but we are on the right path to achieving it.

As we anticipate a future that is changing, our planning to meet those
challenges should be thoughtful and guided by the principles of what we
want Berkeley to be like. We call these core values. These values must
be built into our efforts to build infrastructure for the future. The
Vision 2050 task force developed the following four core values:

-   **Equity** -- -- Ensure benefits are equitably distributed and
    available and that they consider health status and school outcomes
    as well as access to jobs, housing, food and upward mobility

-   **Public health and safety** -- Enhance public health, well-being
    and safety

-   **Strong local economy** -- Develop local skills and capacity to
    keep jobs and economic benefits close to home

-   **Resiliency and sustainability** -- Enhance abilities to withstand
    challenges and support future needs

These core values, applied to our infrastructure, results in:

-   Clean water and air

-   Shared and safe community spaces such as streets, sidewalks, public
    parks and other people-centered places

-   Transportation that connects us, improving mobility for all while
    reducing pollution and energy-use

-   Local and clean energy that is efficient, electrified, low-carbon
    and equitably provided

-   Natural habitats that are biodiverse and thrive in an urban
    environment

-   Fast and widely-accessible communications bringing all residents and
    businesses into the 21^st^ century.

-   Resilient systems that make our schools, homes and businesses ready
    for fire, earthquakes, and floods

Building on Current Infrastructure Planning
===========================================

The City has prepared plans for many infrastructure systems. Some of the
plans were done many years ago and some are recent. The Vision 2050 task
force used the existing plans as the starting point. We want to build on
what has been done and to add recommendations where it is needed. This
section describes the City's current plans and infrastructure
improvement programs.

**Building on the City's Planning**

![](./images/media/image10.png){width="1.1395833333333334in"
height="1.4805555555555556in"}The Vision 2050 task force created a
database of the City's relevant infrastructure plans. The plans were
reviewed and information was summarized in several ways, including their
connection to:

-   Infrastructure systems

-   Core values

-   Criteria from the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure's
    Envision program

-   Date of preparation and current applicability

![](./images/media/image11.png){width="1.4618055555555556in"
height="1.1604166666666667in"}Over 20 plans were reviewed. The plans
that provide the key guidance for our future include the:

-   Climate Action Plan

-   Resilience Strategy

-   Capital Improvement Program

A summary of the current plans and their recommended actions are show on
Appendix 2.

Our review found that the plans were prepared for specific purposes and
often lacked integration. This is improving with the City Manager's
Strategic Plan and the recent Resilience Strategy. We also found no
regular schedule for preparing or updating the plans. Some plans are
current and applicable while others are out of date, incomplete, or have
not been started. Many plans have been only partially implemented.

**Case Studies **

It is valuable to learn from projects and programs implemented in
Berkeley. We can glean from these what has worked well and what
attributes to carry to our future work. Positive case studies include
the Climate Action Plan, Measure T1, and the Center Street Parking
Garage. The attributes that have worked well include the following.

-   Have an executive level "champion" for the project. This provides
    the vision and imperative for the project team.

-   Involve the appropriate commissions early in the project. This will
    provide valuable input and buy in.

-   Involve community organizations and the community, in general, to
    gain input and to educate them on the project.

-   Develop options for the project based on the input. Screen the
    options based on multiple criteria and make recommendations.

-   Provide status reports, including cost and schedule, on a regular
    basis to the public. This can be in reports to City Council, updates
    on websites, or in community meetings.

**Current Infrastructure Investments**

Berkeley's most recent Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for
the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2018, listed the City's total capital
assets at about \$850 million. In a March 19, 2019 report on Projections
of Future Liabilities, the City Manager stated that the City's largest
unfunded liability of \$786 million is infrastructure that has exceeded
its useful lifespan. The available funding to address this failing
infrastructure is about \$33 million, which is about 4.2% of the total
need. As a result, failing infrastructure is kept in service beyond its
useful lifespan and the cost of replacement increases substantially due
to inflation and construction cost escalation as shown in Figure 4.

![](./images/media/image12.jpeg){width="2.9805555555555556in"
height="1.6666666666666667in"}

Berkeley prepares a 5-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) and it is
updated every two years. The CIP outlines the specific projects,
schedule and the funding needs for the following infrastructure systems:

-   City facilities

-   Information systems

-   Parks and marina

-   Sanitary sewer

-   Storm drains

-   Sidewalk repairs

-   Street repairs

-   Transportation

-   Other infrastructure

-   Equipment

Projects shown in the CIP are typically systems that have been studied,
are known to be deficient and improvements are needed to bring them back
to acceptable use. There many infrastructure needs that have not yet

The CIP, along with special revenue funds, bonds, enterprise funds,
transfer taxes, and state and federal funding, provide the funds to
maintain and construct our capital assets and infrastructure. Several
recent actions by the voters have provided an important boost to the
resources available for meeting these challenges:

**Measure T1**, authorizing the City to sell \$100 million of General
Obligation Bonds to repair, renovate, replace, or reconstruct the City's
aging infrastructure and facilities, including sidewalks, storm drains,
parks, streets, senior and recreation centers, and other important City
facilities and buildings.

**Measure F** (a countywide vehicle registration fee), increasing the
Parks Tax revenues approximately 16.7% to support parks, playgrounds,
city trees and landscaping operations and maintenance. Measure F
provided an additional \$750,000 per year to Berkeley for major
maintenance projects, raising annual funding for parks capital and major
maintenance projects from \$250,000 to \$1 million.

**Measure BB** (a property tax assessment), which implements a 30 year
Transportation Expenditure Plan. Berkeley's allocation is approximately
\$2.6 million annually and is applied to improving the pavement
condition and specific street/transportation improvement projects and
increasing funding for local transportation enhancements. Measure BB
will benefit the City's streets and roads, pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure. Measure M (a general obligation bond), to provide an
additional \$30 million which is being used to significantly accelerate
the implementation of the 5-Year Street Plan and install green
infrastructure where appropriate, improving the condition of city
streets and Green Infrastructure projects as defined in the Watershed
Master Plan.

Current Financial Challenges

The City has two major unfunded liabilities: Pension/Benefits and
Infrastructure, both of which are increasing rapidly. From Fy2012 to
FY2019, the unfunded liability for Pensions/Benefits almost doubled from
\$363 million to \$665 million, whereas the Infrastructure unfunded
liability almost tripled from \$325 million to \$882 million. See Table
\_\_\_.

![](./images/media/image13.wmf){width="5.527083333333334in"
height="1.2916666666666667in"}Table \_\_\_\_

From FY2012 to FY2020, the City increased its annual funding of
pension/benefits from \$76.5 million to 115.6 million, which increased
its total Pension/Benefits liquid reserves to \$1,172 million.

Over the same time period, the City funding for infrastructure decreased
\$53.5 million to \$39.8 million, while infrastructure unfunded
liabilities tripled, which is clearly inadequate to maintain the City's
aging infrastructure, let alone modernize it.

Furthermore, most of the City's capital assets do not have reserve funds
associated with them, with the exception of vehicle, building
maintenance and computer/servers, which total only \$19 million, or
fifty times smaller than the Pension/Benefits reserves.

Fig. 5 Liquid Assets & Reserves

While there are many fiscal challenges, the City has some opportunities
as well. First, the public has shown its wiliness to support bond
funding for infrastructure modernization by passing Measures M and T1.
Second, the City demonstrated the benefits of a revenue-funded bond when
it replaced the Center Street Parking Garage with a climate smart
facility, using its cash flow from parking revenues. Third, in FY2020
the City will replace the destroyed Tuolumne Camp facility, funded
primarily with insurance funds, with a modern facility. Fourth, the
proposed 5-yearcapital budget for FYs2020 -- 2024, increases capital
spending to \~\$67 million/year, which is a substantial increase over
the previous plan.

Future Challenges for Our Infrastructure 
=========================================

As we look to replace or upgrade our current infrastructure, we must
address many challenges, such as decreasing fossil fuels, increases in
population, drought, wildfires and flooding, and information privacy and
security threats, while also taking advantage of various opportunities,
such as local energy generation, electrification, micro-grids, access to
real-time information, and the re-design of our public commons.
Following are summaries of those challenges.

**Demographic Trends in Berkeley**

The Vision 2050 initiative, which covers 2018 through 2050, focuses on
how to provide what infrastructure to best serve the current and future
population of Berkeley. Plan Bay Area (PBA) projects regional changes in
employment, population, numbers of households, and housing units for the
years 2010 through 2040. We've taken the 2040 projections and
extrapolated them to 2050 for Berkeley. The PBA considered 3 different
scenarios for projecting changes in employment and population, and chose
the "modest growth" scenario, which follows national trends. The
region's number of jobs and population surged from 2010 to 2015.

**More People are Projected**

Figure \_\_\_\_ summarizes the expected changes in population, jobs,
households, and housing units from 2010 through 2040 for the Bay region.
Both population and jobs experienced rapid growth from 2010 to 2015.
One-fourth of the projected population growth and half of the job growth
occurred in that 5-year period and the growth of both are expected to
slow significantly from 2015 through 2040. The number of households
increased by only 13% of that 5-year period and numbers of housing units
by only 8%.

height="3.1770833333333335in"}

**More Diverse, but Lower Percentage of Working-Age Adults**

We assume that demographic changes in Berkeley in the coming 35 years
will be like that of Alameda County and the region.

-   Racial and ethnic balance will become less white and more Latino and
    Asian.

-   Household incomes at the moderate and above-moderate levels will
    decrease somewhat and those at the low and very low levels will
    increase a little bit.

-   Like the rest of the country the number of working age adults will
    decrease from 3.5 per retirement age adult to 2.5 per retirement age
    person.

-   The number of people over 65 will double, from 12% to 22% of the
    population.

![](./images/media/image16.png){width="4.764583333333333in"
height="2.5in"}Applying regional percentages to estimate 2015 and 2050
levels for the City of Berkeley:

-   Berkeley's growth in households, housing units, jobs and population
    are slightly below that expected for the County of Alameda and the
    region.

-   Between 2015 and 2050 the population, the number of households and
    the number of housing units in Berkeley are estimated to increase
    about 26-27%. Growth in jobs for that time is expected to increase
    by only 20%. As in the rest of the region, a great deal of job
    growth has already occurred, and the numbers of people, households,
    and housing units will catch up.

For planning future infrastructure, about 2/3 of the increase in
households is expected to occur along the major transit corridors.

**Quality of Life Challenges**

The quality-of-life challenges fall into two categories -- impacts
resulting from **infrastructure decisions** and the need to improve
quality of life by prioritizing some infrastructure expenditures over
others. To date, most Berkeley plans fall into the first category and
the current decision-making process makes it difficult to address
challenges in the second category.

**Current Long-term Planning**

Long-term plans in Berkeley historically have focused on:

-   Geographic location (i.e., Downtown Area Plan, West Berkeley Plan)
    that address land use issues, including limited infrastructure goals

-   Type of infrastructure (i.e., Parks Plan, Marina Plan, Bicycle
    Plan); they address improvements to existing infrastructure, but are
    bound by the size and location of existing infrastructure

-   Meeting statewide mandates (i.e., the Climate Action Plan, the
    Resilience Plan) to reduce the city-wide impacts of climate warming
    and to ensure a fast and efficient recovery from major disasters

Many of these plans seek to minimize infrastructure impacts on quality
of life (add example) or to improve quality of life (by improving parks,
pathways, etc.), either directly or indirectly. The third category of
plans take a new approach -- to preserve city-wide quality of life
through more far reaching plans and interdepartmental coordination.

**Why are there Challenges?**

With such good plans, why do we face "quality of life" challenges?
First, how well these long-term plans protect or enhance quality of life
depends entirely on how they are implemented and monitored. The current
process assigns departments to implement each plan, or a portion of a
plan, as the City Council makes funds available. As would be expected,
the Council prioritizes capital funding to mitigate current crises and
current needs, which tend to be near-term not long-term.

Second, the departmental decision-making process includes little
involvement from other departments, no feedback loop, and no way to
measure impacts on quality of life or evaluate how to plan better the
next time. Even though many of these plans mention ways to mitigate or
enhance quality of life, without a feedback loop or performance
measures, we don't know if these are just words intended to "sell" the
plans.

Third, despite everyone's best intentions, the current process of
implementing and funding infrastructure makes it almost impossible for
the City of Berkeley to use quality of life as a decision-making tool.
For example, important tradeoffs cannot be considered. Should
neighborhoods with a high percentage of seniors have priority in
sidewalk repairs over other neighborhoods? Should repairing sidewalks
near senior facilities be a higher priority than repairing streets used
primarily by non-seniors? Should small neighborhood parks take priority
over wetland rehabilitation needed to mitigate impacts of rising sea
level? The piecemeal process for making infrastructure decisions in
Berkeley removes any opportunity to improve quality of life by
coordinating infrastructure development more broadly and over a longer
time horizon.

**Responding to Future Challenges**

In the coming 30 years, physical environmental crisis that we face will
become more frequent, making it even more important that we coordinate
planning and funding procedures for developing infrastructure, over a
longer time horizon. Increased heat will have a disproportionate impact
on the health and comfort of seniors and young children, especially
those unable to afford air conditioning. And demographic projections
indicate that the percentage of seniors will continue to increase!
Wildland fires will increase making evacuation for disabled individuals
more critical. Air quality will decrease due to increased smoke from
nearby fires and changes in wind direction due to warmer land. Homes in
lower-income neighborhoods are most vulnerable to flooding related to
sea level rise and the least able financially to bear the burden.

To meet these challenges, we need a new decision-making process that
includes social equity as a key decision-making criterion, as well as a
measure of impacts. \[more to come . . . \]

**Environmental Challenges**

In the past 50 years, we've planned for "suitability" by trying to match
land uses to the capacity of a site. We've also planned for
"sustainability" by trying to minimize our impacts on the environment,
while supporting biodiversity and other ecosystem services. And we've
planned for "resilience" by seeking to increase our capacity to recover
quickly from events like earthquakes, fires and temporary flooding. But
this new era of infrastructure planning will have to contend with
changes in the environments that have seemed relatively stable in the
past.

Our City has declared a Climate Emergency. According to the 4^th^
California Climate Assessment, new climate conditions will lead to more
frequent major fires and intense precipitation events, reduce our air
quality and regional biodiversity, and gradually flood the coastal
highways, parks and neighborhoods of cities around the Bay Area. With
all the things we've planned in the past -- road systems, sewer systems,
new towns, new airports, etc. \-- we haven't planned for an environment
that is changing so much that it will require us to adapt.

The big changes that will affect Berkeley are increasing heat, rainfall
extremes and rising sea levels. These will affect many other critical
trends, like maintenance costs and health. The City needs a vision that
reflects how these trends are connected. Our shared public investments
and policies need to help us mitigate fossil fuel emissions and adapt to
long-term changes like rising seas, as well as build our resilience to
short-term events, such as a heat wave or an extreme rainstorm.

**Increasing Heat**

Hotter air leads to more intense rainfall, drier vegetation, and air
quality problems that impact people's health. Research shows the links
between increased air temperature and people's health, the health of
urban trees that could cool our homes, and the maintenance costs for our
infrastructure. More heat means higher maintenance costs and lower
performance for conventional "gray" infrastructure. California's 4^th^
Climate Assessment is the best science-based prediction of our future
local climate. It says Berkeley can expect an increase in air
temperature, along with boom-and-bust rainfall years.

![](./images/media/image17.png){width="4.926388888888889in"
height="3.051388888888889in"}Observations since 1950 show a decrease in
the number of foggy days. In dry years, we'll have less fog and less
humidity. That could cause an increase in the mortality of park and
street trees, as well as on private property. If we water more, we'll
increase water demand and would need to be ready for that. If the trees
die, they can't provide shade, leading to even higher air temperatures
and energy demand in buildings. Dead and dry vegetation is more
dangerous as a fuel for fire in the hills of Berkeley. Increased air
temperatures can lead to asthma attacks and other respiratory problems
-- particularly if the air doesn't cool off quickly at night, and trees
aren't around to filter the air. More frequent fires will lead to losses
of property, reduce air quality, and potentially risk people's lives.
There is evidence that hotter streets need more frequent maintenance,
and that hotter streets are associated with breaks in underground water
pipes. That's a lot to plan for, and it means we need to know how these
things are connected when we plan.

**Significant Changes in Precipitation**

California's 4th Climate Assessment projects that the Bay Area will
experience more "boom and bust" years --- both very wet and very dry
conditions --- in the coming decades. Our largest winter storms, called
"atmospheric rivers," will likely become more intense, bringing
challenges to Berkeley's stormwater system, making potholes more
ubiquitous and deeper, and flooding key facilities. At the same time,
longer and deeper droughts --- like the 2012-16 drought which led to the
most severe moisture deficits in the last 1,200 years --- will parch our
precious parks and open spaces. Even if rainfall totals don't increase,
higher temperatures and longer heatwaves will dry out vegetation
significantly, increasing fire danger and degrading streetscapes and
green areas.

Warmer temperatures are also predicted to make a substantial change in
the Sierra snowpack, source of the vast proportion of EBMUD's water
supply. Under a high emissions scenario in California's 4th Climate
Assessment, the average Sierra snowpack will decline by 20% in the next
few decades, 30%-60% in mid-century, and over 80% in the late 21st
century. Consecutive years of low or no snowpack are especially
worrisome. In addition, warmer temperatures are producing a shift to
earlier snowmelt in the Sierra, posing storage and supply problems for
high water demand periods that occur in hot summers and falls.

**Fire Risk**

history burned between October and December 2017. There were 7,117
wildfires that year, compared to the historic average of 4,835. The
carnage continued in 2018 with 5,847 fires before the traditional "fire
season" even began, destroying over 1 million acres, thousands of homes,
and taking dozens of lives. The entire town of Paradise burned to the
ground in less than two hours, taking close to 90 lives with it.

Climate change has increased temperatures and drought, which will
inevitably lead to even more severe fires. Diablo wind-driven fires are
impossible to stop while these strong winds are blowing. But taking
steps to reverse climate change can minimize the severity of wildfires.
This can be done by utilizing more solar and wind-generated power
instead of burning coal and natural gas, better insulating homes and
businesses to conserve energy, shutting down utilities in high wind
conditions, providing more public transportation, planting more
climate-moderating trees, creating viable escape routes in high hazard
fire areas, improving emergency warning systems and taking other
significant steps needed to lower emissions and stabilize climate.

Many large wildland/urban interface fires duplicate the destruction
similar fires caused years before. The Tubbs Fire that burned through
Santa Rosa followed the same path as a 1964 fire. Our local 1991 Tunnel
Fire followed the same path as the 1970 one. As of yet, no fire has
followed the path of Berkeley's 1923 one. But one inevitably will. Each
fire destroyed way more homes and took more lives than the earlier
fires, due to the increase in population density. Despite that, Berkeley
is encouraging even denser housing by facilitating ADUs (accessory
dwelling units), even in the dangerous hills high fire hazard zone. This
is a recipe for disaster, especially considering the narrow winding
streets that must serve as evacuation routes. Many streets in the hills,
hardly any of which lead directly downhill, don't come anywhere close to
meeting current State standards for street width. The majority of these
streets cause traffic backups even under normal conditions. And a
significant percentage of Berkeley's population lives in the hills. And
those who don't live there are not out of danger considering the
destruction of the Coffey Park flatlands of Santa Rosa that burned to
the ground during the Tubbs Fire.

Fires will burn following an earthquake that could destroy much of the
city and its infrastructure within the next 20 years. Some predictions
include destruction of hundreds of buildings, loss of power for weeks
and destruction of 5,000 water lines, most of which will not be repaired
for months. Multiple fires will burn out of control as well. Thousands
of people will either move out of town or need to live in shelters
post-earthquake. School will close. Businesses will fail. Plans must be
developed and action taken soon to make the city as resilient as
possible in the face of these threats.

Both the City and its residents must take immediate action to strengthen
and improve the fire resistance of our homes and businesses in the face
of catastrophic climate change and the inevitable fires, floods,
droughts and landslides it will cause. This can include undergrounding
utilities along the main evacuation routes, requiring Class A
fire-resistant roofing and double pane windows, removal of flammable
trees and hedges, ensuring that home fire alarms are functioning,
expanding fire safety inspection capabilities, imposing reasonable
limits on street parking on excessively narrow hill streets,
construction of turnouts to take parked cars off streets, increasing
public education programs about fire safety, installing redundant
emergency warning systems, encouraging more citizens to take CERT
classes, and more.

Native plants have adapted to the fire ecology of our state, and
re-sprout from the roots or from dormant seeds after fires.
Unfortunately, this isn't possible for homes or people. We need an
effective plan of action to minimize the impacts of future disasters.
Then we need to implement it.

**Earthquakes and Landslides**

Berkeley's Local Hazard Mitigation Plan identifies earthquake and
rainfall triggered landslides as likely hazards with catastrophic
severity of impact. Most of our thinking about acute land changes
centers on building structures but the impacts to our infrastructure
range from rupture and blockage of water, sewer and gas pipelines to
toppling of power and communication poles and overhead structures.
Streets and sidewalk buckling and failure will impede emergency
responders and evacuation routes. Any failures in these critical
infrastructure systems will disrupt service. (LHMP 2019 B-13)

**Sea Level Rise**

Both California's 4^th^ Climate Assessment and the State of California's
recent guidance to public agencies on sea level rise tell us that
Berkeley can expect to see significant sea level rise over the next
20-80 years, and long after that. Although no one knows exactly how much
the Bay will rise and by when, the State has provided a range of
estimates to show the low risk, medium-high risk, and extreme risk
scenarios.

For 2050, the State has identified a range of likely sea level rises of
between 1.1 to 2.7 feet. By 2100 the projections indicate increases from
3.5 to over 10 feet above today's sea level. As scientists have learned
more about the dynamics of ice sheet melting, they have developed
scenarios for even greater sea level rise. Many scientists now believe
that the amount of carbon and methane in the atmosphere today has
committed us to an eventual rise in sea level of about 10 feet. No
matter what the sea level is in 2100, it will continue to rise until
some equilibrium is reached between the elevated levels of CO2 present
and the amount of heat already trapped in the ocean. Figure \_\_ shows
the estimated range of sea level rise in the Berkeley area.

![](./images/media/image19.png){width="6.166666666666667in"
height="3.8583333333333334in"}

California's science-based guidance to public agencies recommends that
local jurisdictions consider "medium-high risk" predictions when
planning long-term facilities (i.e., facilities meant to last 20-50
years). For investments meant to last beyond 50 years, the State
recommends that we consider the potential for an extreme sea level rise
scenario.

No matter what the sea level actually is in 2050, it will be much higher
in 2100 and beyond. That's how accelerating trends work, they change
faster over time. But there's no point in building things for a sea
level rise that won't see long term use. We need to consider the
expected lifetime of the things we build, as well as the rate of sea
level change. Many scientists think that we'll know a lot more about
which sea level trend is actually occurring in the next decade or two.
If so, there may be reasonable moral arguments that current generations
should do and pay for more adaptation, since we are causing the change.
However we decide to respond to that challenge, it's as critical not to
waste money preparing infrastructure investments for sea level rise if
those structures are not intended to last more than a few decades as it
will be to ensure longer lived assets are prepared to withstand
potential extreme sea level rise.

Coastal parks and bike trails will be affected -- both by sea level rise
directly, and by increased erosion from wave action that reaches higher
areas of the land. This will push us to decide where public access (and
private facilities that pay fees to the City) will continue, and where
these will be lost or reconfigured. Intertidal wetlands will be lost
unless investments are made to raise the surface elevation of the
wetlands, or they are allowed to migrate inland onto lands that are now
roads, parking, or other uses.

**Combined Effects**

![](./images/media/image20.png){width="5.53125in"
height="3.0833333333333335in"}Sea level rise is a trend that is very
likely to produce unexpected effects through networks of causes and
effects. The US Geological Survey has shown that rising sea levels will
cause groundwater -- the water that rises and falls in the soil as rain
and tides influence it - to also rise within a few miles of the
shoreline. This could flood sewer pipes and basements. It could also
move soil pollution around, creating serious health threats. It can
cause corrosion of pipes and problems with underground electrical
utilities. Street pavement is more prone to cracking in a
high-groundwater environment. High groundwater can increase the risk of
extreme shaking in an earthquake, risking damage to property and loss of
life. We can adapt to this challenge, but we need to see the
cause-and-effect network connections in order to choose the right
investment and design strategies. Loss of marshes will devastate
biodiversity historically hosted in vegetated bayshores.

While other lower lying communities around the Bay will experience
serious impacts from sea level rise before Berkeley, we will all be
impacted within the life span of many of our infrastructure investments.
Our regional wastewater, transportation, refineries and pipelines, will
require significant adaptation investment. Many regional facilities will
need to be relocated. Our bay shoreline, roadways and western
neighborhoods already suffer flooding impacts of rising sea and
groundwater levels when combined with severe storms and king tides. Long
term infrastructure investments should be evaluated frequently against
evolving sea level rise data and projections.

**There is not one answer for Berkeley**

Our city grew in the 19^th^ century along the shipping corridors on the
bay with the pier and the railroads moving goods and people north and
south from the farms and factories. With the establishment of the
University, the center of town shifted east from old Oceanview and
Berkeley spread developing our 20^th^ century grid of water, sewer, and
gas underground and telephone and power overhead along the street right
of ways from bay to the hills.

Our infrastructure corridors connect us, providing transportation,
water, waste, power and communication networks. But from an
infrastructure and climate point of view, Berkeley has three different
"zones" with different challenges.

![](./images/media/image21.png){width="2.595833333333333in"
height="2.0in"}The hills have the highest risk of fires, seismic shaking
and landslides. Steep slopes and narrow, winding roads make evacuation
difficult. Adaptation will require careful management of vegetation, and
finding opportunities to shelter in place when evacuation is
impractical. Water pressure needs to be high for fire-fighting, and
electric utilities should probably be placed underground.

Flooding risks are most important in the flats, as climate change and
development increase runoff from higher elevations. Rising sea levels
and groundwater will keep water from seeping into the soil and flowing
into the Bay. The flats also have worse air quality, thanks to heavy
traffic on Interstate 880, University, Ashby and San Pablo Avenues.
Buried infrastructure will need to be waterproof, and the risks of
extreme shaking may increase as groundwater rises. The neighborhoods
need more trees and less gas-powered traffic to improve air quality.

![](./images/media/image22.png){width="2.5909722222222222in"
height="2.0in"}Downtown Berkeley is particularly vulnerable to heat, as
density increases along with traffic. South Berkeley also has high
traffic flows and needs safer streets and sidewalks for bikes and
pedestrians. These neighborhoods need greener infrastructure (trees and
rain gardens) to help manage both storm water and air quality. Since
they sit at the base of the hills, storm water and groundwater can
emerge as springs and flood basements. Infrastructure and sidewalks need
to be enlarged and re-designed to handle growth and development, making
the sidewalks into more people-friendly public space. South Berkeley has
provided affordable housing and community space for diverse families.
Future development should prioritize their housing and public space
needs, and not displace people who are part of Berkeley's community.

These different parts of Berkeley have different needs. Planning needs
to recognize historic and present inequalities, and avoid using
"equality" (i.e., giving everyone the same thing) as a substitute for
"equity" (which is making sure people have access to what they need).
Funding for some very local needs should come from the people who
benefit the most, and for other issues, funding may come from a broad
base.

**Technology Pathways**

Technology trends are changing the way we use the city's infrastructure
and existing infrastructure does not meet future needs. Furthermore, new
technology needs to be energy efficient, electrified, decentralized,
low-carbon, integrated with our buildings and public infrastructure, and
widely and equitably accessible. We note particularly that the benefits
of technology change are not likely to be shared widely without some
intervention by the city. And finally, proactive steps are needed to
protect quality of life and mediate the potential negative impacts of
technology.

But it is impossible to predict exactly what technologies will be
available 5 years from now, let alone 30 years from now when we reach
2050. Rather, we seek to define general principles to guide City
procurement and plan implementation, and to inform customer-facing
policies and practices. Staying in the context of City procurement, and
the responsibility for the Public Right of Way, we identified 6
technology pathways - Building, Energy, Transportation, IT, Water and
Waste Management - that will impact the services that the City must
provide. Each of these technology pathways has seen dramatic changes and
many more are expected. Without knowing the specific evolution of each
technology pathway, we can set up the general principles that a
technology should satisfy (and the levers that the City has to encourage
compliance):

1.  Energy Efficient (Reach Codes, etc.)

2.  Electrified (Fuel switching, rebates, etc.)

3.  Decentralized (Resilient and promoting consumer choice)

4.  Low Carbon (Increased reliance on solar and wind, walkable City)

5.  Integrated (i.e. with City Plans, as in undergrounding and paving;
    also with private buildings)

6.  Equitably distributed (Rebates, Incentives, wide area coverage,
    geographically distributed, low barriers to entry)

So for example, our roads and Public Right of Way should prioritize safe
access for pedestrians, bikers, low cost widely available zero carbon
public transit fleets, EV charging, and on-demand services for Seniors
and Youth.

### 

### Technology Services

Services refer to the core functions of the City of Berkeley in 2050. We
have listed 7 functions described briefly below:

1.  [Building Services]{.underline}: Buildings support basic residential
    services like comfort and shelter, commercial activities, City
    services, information and communications hubs, and they define the
    "grid edge" with respect to energy services from PG&E and East Bay
    Community Energy.

2.  [Transportation Services]{.underline}: Transportation networks,
    including roadways, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian bike paths,
    public transit systems, fleets, and shared and private
    vehicles/private automobiles move people, goods and services around
    the City.

3.  [Energy Services]{.underline}: Energy services in the City of
    Berkeley refers to the production, distribution and consumption of
    energy used to provide basic residential and commercial needs,
    including end-use appliances and self-generation.

4.  [Communications/Information Services]{.underline}: Physical and
    logical communications infrastructure, and overlapping security and
    identity infrastructure support the safe and timely flow of
    information and data between individuals, equipment and
    infrastructure in the City of Berkeley.

5.  [Water and Waste-water Services]{.underline}: Refers to complete
    hydrological cycle: rain and storm water, surface flows and
    containment, subsurface groundwater flows, clean water and
    wastewater distribution and treatment, and quality assurance for all
    end uses.

6.  [Waste Management Services]{.underline}: Waste management begins
    with how and what we consume, and then include diversion to re-use,
    recycling and compost before any solid waste is generated.

7.  [Emergency Services]{.underline}: Fire, Police, Medical and Mental
    Health assets must be deployed to resolve inevitable conflicts,
    disasters and disruptions to City life.

### Technology Trends

**[Buildings]{.underline}**

By 2050, buildings in Berkeley will be significantly more energy and
water efficient, electrified, and connected. They will also host
increasing capacity for local energy generation and storage. They will
be increasingly efficient in water use and waste water treatment. To
accommodate these changes, buildings will need efficiency improvements,
electrical service upgrades, IT infrastructure improvements, and water
use improvements. Berkeley has direct control over municipal buildings
and infrastructure, and can use City Ordinances and financial incentive
programs to effect change in the private building stock.

**[Transportation]{.underline}**

Certainly the City will have to grapple with the electrification of
transportation, including private Electric Vehicles (EVs), and our
Public Right of Way must make some accommodations to EV charging for
light, medium and heavy duty transport. There may also be an increase in
autonomous vehicle traffic, but that remains to be seen. The more
important trend will be move people out of private vehicles entirely
onto streets that are bicycle and pedestrian friendly, public transit
oriented, environmentally durable, and more accessible for public
utility upgrades.

**[Energy]{.underline}**

By 2050, Berkeley seeks an energy system that delivers carbon free
electricity across a highly distributed system, capable of providing
reliability and resilience while serving the needs of fully electrified
building and transportation sectors. California has established a policy
framework that will achieve a carbon free grid within that time frame,
but Berkeley has the ability to accelerate the progress towards that
goal within the City limits.[^1] In any case, Berkeley has significant
control and influence over local energy infrastructure and technology
choices, particularly for public and city assets. Multiple and
multifaceted changes to that infrastructure and its uses will be
required to achieve the Vision 2050 carbon goals, as well as other
values prioritized in the plan. In general, these changes can be
summarized as: 1) maximize energy efficiency, 2) electrify everything
possible, 3) decarbonize and clean up the grid, and 4) squeeze fossil
fuels out. Other changes, like undergrounding of utilities, while not
strictly required for decarbonization, may be necessary to achieve
resilience, reliability, access and equity (democratic). Incentives for
home electrification, including heat pump technology and induction
cooking are an important tool for the City, particularly targeted at low
income households.

**[Information]{.underline}**

By 2050, information flows in Berkeley will change fundamentally, in
quantity, in quality, and in granularity. Common objects will
communicate with each other. Data will be stored and retrieved at
molecular and atomic level. In short, where electrons flow, there will
be information exchange. All electrical and electronic devices\--
automobiles, trucks, appliances, communication devices, entertainment
devices, information infrastructure components, lighting devices\--will
be able to communicate. Major infrastructure components\--road surfaces,
beams and column elements of buildings, load-bearing components of
bridges and towers, all piping and pumping infrastructure for water,
wastewater, airflow and air conditioning, all cabling and energy
transport infrastructure\--will gradually incorporate sensing and
communication of real-time state information. The City must make plans
to manage this flow of information, as well as to address any issues
that arise from the inevitable risk to privacy. Communications protocols
are not the domain of the City, but rather must be thought of as a
compliance objective. Particular care must be taken to ensure that
Emergency Services has full access to the flow of information.

**[Water]{.underline}**

With climate change, increasing variations in water supply, and extremes
in drought conditions and periods of intense rainfall, Berkeley's
infrastructure must be prepared for these conditions and work closely
with EBMUD and regional agencies. Storm water capture, ground water
recharge, grey water treatment, reclamation and reuse all have
technological innovations we need to incorporate in our local
infrastructure.

**[Waste]{.underline}**

By 2050, Berkeley will have made significant reductions in disposal of
single-use products, and also expanded the range of materials that can
be reused, recycled, or composted. To accommodate these changes, new
businesses or government services will need to exist, and changes will
need to be made at the Transfer Station and other facilities.

**Our Opportunities**

**Economic Growth and Job Creation**

Investments in our infrastructure have historically created economic
opportunities, and it can now, too. Investments made through the WPA
transformed Berkeley, creating jobs and significant community resources
such as our beloved Rose Garden. Investments made in undergrounding BART
through our city enabled us to have a vibrant downtown that is not under
the shadow of or divided by BART tracks, as well as the Ohlone Greenway.
We have an opportunity as we replace our end-of-life infrastructure to
create significant economic opportunity.

**Re-thinking the Public Commons**

As we dig up our streets to upgrade the infrastructure, as well as
consider how transportation changes will be incorporated, we have an
opportunity to re-consider and re-prioritize how we use our
publicly-owned land, designing them to balance the needs of all those
using the spaces. Berkeley's streets cover more than 12% of the entire
city, a total of about 800 acres. We generally see the streets as a
means for transportation -- walking, cycling and driving, although they
are also a place for community gathering and transaction---meeting
neighbors on the sidewalk to chat, having lunch at a sidewalk café,
window shopping, or just enjoying a stroll. They are spaces that we
spend a significant amount of our time, whether sitting in a car or on a
bus, walking to the office or school, or meeting a friend for lunch.

Since Roman times, cities have used the public rights-of-way to convey
people and goods on the ground plane, and water, wastewater and
stormwater below the ground plane. In the last 100 years, natural gas
has been added to the below ground utilities and some neighborhoods have
underground power and telecommunications systems. Most neighborhoods,
however, obtain these "wired" services from above ground utilities. All
of these conveyances -- transportation, water, wastewater, power,
communications -- use the right-of-way.

Unfortunately, while there is a single city-owned right-of-way, we've
designed, financed and maintained these infrastructure systems
separately and created separate City department, regional agencies, and
private entities to build and maintain them. This is understandable, as
power and gas is provided by a regulated private corporate monopoly,
potable water is provided by a public regional utility,
telecommunications is provided by multiple competing privately owned
systems while the city is responsible for stormwater and wastewater
conveyance.

**Our opportunities to improve our city in the public right-of-way
include:**

-   [Financial Responsibility]{.underline} -- Non-city owned entities
    are responsible for maintaining their assets in the public
    right-of-way. They are also responsible for repairing damage to the
    surface when they access their underground assets.

-   [Coordination]{.underline} -- The city is responsible for
    coordinating right-of-way access by all users -- including drivers,
    pedestrians and utilities -- but that coordination is often lacking,
    resulting in uncoordinated street projects and increased expenses
    for all utility and right-of-way providers.

-   [Right of Way Beneficiaries]{.underline} -- A city's public
    right-of-way provides significant, even essential benefits to the
    owners of the adjacent property. Without street access -- for
    transportation or utilities -- property would have little value.
    Accordingly, property owners should be expected to provide some
    level of support for maintenance of the public right-of-way. The
    actual users of the right-of-way -- motorists, utility users, etc.
    -- should also pay for a share of the right-of-way.

-   [Rigid Definitions of Enterprise Funds]{.underline} -- A key aspect
    in the lack of coordination is overly rigid and legalistic
    allocation of enterprise funds. Staff often balk at coordination
    efforts because the funding source is, for example, sewers, and a
    more coordinated effort could result in some sewer funds being used
    for paving or green infrastructure. While well intentioned, this
    results in overall sub-optimal outcomes for the city's overall
    infrastructure. All users -- the ultimate funders of these
    enterprise funds -- benefit from comprehensive first-class
    infrastructure and the current rigid definitions should be relaxed
    to achieve the overall goal.

-   [Street Maintenance, Funding and Trends]{.underline} -- Berkeley
    underspends on its street paving by about \$10 million annually.
    Funding for the street rehabilitation program is from many sources,
    but the on-going program is funded from revenues generated by motor
    vehicle fuel taxes (about \$2.5 million annually) and recently the
    county transportation sales tax has also funded about \$2.5 million.
    The on-going program funding is about \$7 million annually, well
    below the required spending levels to ensure high-quality street
    pavement.

> Even this funding level is likely to diminish in future years. While
> the State Legislature passed a 12-cent fuel tax increase (which was
> upheld by the voters in November 2018) and indexed the tax to
> inflation, motor vehicle fuel taxes are a diminishing resource. As
> transportation electrification accelerates, fuel tax revenue will
> decrease. As vehicle autonomy is perfected, shared-ride costs could
> drop significantly, access to services could increase dramatically and
> more shared-ride trips could occur, and curb management will become
> paramount.

-   [Quality of Life]{.underline} -- Viewing our public commons as
    exactly that--the "commons" where we meet, transact and facilitate
    transportation. The coming changes provide an opportunity to make
    the time we spend in these spaces more enjoyable and more conducive
    to community strength and resilience by strengthening our physical
    health and social connections.

**Ecosystem Preservation and Restoration**

More sustainable infill growth will concentrate people in urban
environments where green space is a critical component to quality of
life. Protecting existing canopy while reducing fire risk and finding
adequate space for new trees in densely engineered developments is a
challenge, as is achieving a more equitable distribution of tree canopy
across the socio-economic landscape.

Healthy urban forests can produce ecosystem functions, goods and
services that benefit humans and the environment. Ecosystem services
include energy conservation, air quality improvement, carbon storage,
storm water runoff reduction and wildlife and pollinator habitat.
Wildland-urban interface zone fire landscaping and dense development on
private property underscores the need to ensure tree canopy in the
public right of way.

With marshland being the current most effective living carbon capture
system, our infrastructure investment for carbon sequestration should
include marsh restoration and development in addition to conventional
grey infrastructure hardening along our shoreline.

Our Recommendations
===================

The City of Berkeley has an infrastructure system that has allowed us to
thrive and grow for over 100 years. The Vision 2050 team commends the
City for the planning it has done and the programs underway to keep our
systems working. Now is the time to incorporate new technologies and to
adapt to environmental trends that will allow the systems to support us
for another 100 years. The Vision 2050 task force has reviewed the
City's work to date and has drawn on the expertise of our members. With
careful thought, we provide the following recommendations for your
consideration.

The task force recommends that any future infrastructure project
prioritize quality of life. Every project should be vetted and meet all
the quality of life core value metrics that were presented in Chapter 2
and in the table below. Just like every infrastructure project should be
sustainable, and through its implementation provide an easier movement
of people and goods, it should also provide an opportunity to improve
the lives of all Berkeley residents. The infrastructure projects must
provide upward mobility, resilience, safety, and access to healthier and
equitable urban environment in which everyone can have the opportunity
to thrive.

The task force recommends that the quality of life core values serve as
the guiding standard to inform, rank, and approve future infrastructure
projects.

Furthermore, the task force recommends this tool be used as a metric to
gauge how quality of life is improved at a community and individual
level for disadvantaged residents. The task force recommends
disadvantaged residents to be, but not limited to, communities of color,
children, elderly, low-income, disabled, homeless, immigrants. Projects
that do not meet all criteria shall be revised and properly address
before receiving final approval. Additionally, the responsible
department for infrastructure projects should create a scoring mechanism
to give priority to areas and infrastructure projects with highest
urgency, these projects and areas will be prioritized using the core
values matrix and be highly weighted on equity values.

  **Quality of Life Core values**

Equity is an important part that each infrastructure project must
address. The following equity considerations must be incorporated:
health status outcomes, school outcomes, access to jobs and housing,
access to upward mobility, access to food, with an eye towards creating
opportunities for young people, include health equity.

**Policies to Move Us Forward**

Policies are the principles adopted by the City Council that guides
staff on how to carry out its work. The Vision 2050 task force
recommends the following new policies for our City. The policies were
formulated to address the following challenges.

**Life Cycle Infrastructure Management Policy**

Life Cycle Infrastructure Management is a process that Berkeley can use
to make sure that planned maintenance can be conducted and capital
assets (pipes, streets, equipment, etc.) can be repaired, replaced, or
upgraded on time and that there is enough money to pay for it.

Life cycle management is the practice of managing infrastructure capital
assets to minimize the total cost of owning and operating these assets
while delivering the desired service levels. Many cities use this
practice to pursue and achieve sustainable infrastructure. A
high-performing life cycle management program includes detailed asset
inventories, operation and maintenance tasks, and long-range financial
planning. Cities are responsible for making sure that its system stays
in good working order, regardless of the age of its components. Life
cycle management programs with good data---including asset attributes
(e.g., age, condition, and criticality), life-cycle costing, proactive
operations and maintenance, and capital replacement plans based on
cost-benefit analyses---can be the most efficient method of meeting this
challenge. The benefits that can be realized through life cycle
management include:

-   Prolonging asset life and improving decisions about asset
    rehabilitation, repair, and replacement

-   Meeting consumer demands with a focus on system sustainability

-   Setting rates based on sound operational and financial planning

-   Budgeting focused on critical activities for sustained performance

-   Meeting service expectations and regulatory requirements

-   Improving responses to emergencies

-   Improving the security and safety of assets

-   Reducing overall costs for both operations and capital expenditures

    Life cycle management principles have been used by the private
    industries for a long time. In the public sector, the major
    infrastructure systems (highways, water systems, airports, ports,
    etc.) built after World War II have deteriorated over time and asset
    management principles were called in to help. Over the past 40+
    years, the U.K., Australia, and the United States have implemented
    life cycle management programs in the highway, water, airport, and
    other infrastructure systems.

    We recommend that Berkeley adopt a life cycle infrastructure
    management policy that includes the following.

<!-- -->

-   Define the purpose and outcome objectives of having a life cycle
    infrastructure management program

-   Define the infrastructure systems that will be involved with the
    program

-   Define the components of the program

-   Define the part of the organization responsible for the program

-   Define the reporting and oversight requirements

    **Multi-criteria Evaluation Policy**

    Berkeley has many policies and written plans that guide the
    evaluation of infrastructure decisions. However, the City does not
    have a set of clear consistent criteria on how to conduct the
    evaluations. Knowing that our city has a limit on its financial
    resources, a limit on its staff resources, and an engaged informed
    community, it would be helpful to have a balanced and transparent
    approach to decision making.

    ![](./images/media/image23.png){width="1.225in"
    height="1.1875in"}The Vision 2050 task force recommends the use of
    multi-criteria evaluation for decision making. An example of this
    the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) concept. TBL analysis seeks to quantify
    financial, environmental and social impacts and value them to the
    extent practical, while retaining all significant non-quantified or
    non-valued impacts as part of a structure economic summary
    description of decision alternatives. Leading public agencies, such
    as Seattle Public Utilities, and many private companies are using
    TBL.

    ![](./images/media/image24.png){width="1.3395833333333333in"
    height="1.7291666666666667in"}Another example is the Envision
    program, organized by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure.
    Envision is an objective framework of criteria designed to help
    identify ways in which sustainable approaches can be used to plan,
    design, construct and operate infrastructure projects. Envision not
    only asks, "Are we doing the project right?" but also, "Are we doing
    the right project? Envision is a framework that includes 64
    sustainability and resilience indicators, called 'credits',
    organized around five categories: Quality of Life, Leadership,
    Resource Allocation, Natural World, and Climate and Resilience.
    These collectively address areas of human wellbeing, mobility,
    community development, collaboration, planning, economy, materials,
    energy, water, sitting, conservation, ecology, emissions, and
    resilience. These indicators collectively become the foundation of
    what constitutes sustainability in infrastructure.

Each of the 64 credits has multiple levels of achievement representing
the spectrum of possible performance goals from slightly improving
beyond conventional practice, to conserving and restoring communities
and environments. By assessing achievement in each of the 64 credits,
project teams establish how well the project addresses the full range of
sustainability indicators, and are challenged to pursue higher
performance.

We recommend that Berkeley adopt a multi-criteria evaluation policy that
includes the following.

-   Define the purpose and outcome objectives of having multi-criteria
    evaluation

-   Define the infrastructure systems that will be involved with the
    program

-   Define the components of the program and the optional tools

-   Define the part of the organization responsible for the program

-   Define the reporting and oversight requirements

    **One Dig Policy**

    ![](./images/media/image25.jpeg){width="1.8145833333333334in"
    height="1.3604166666666666in"}The City coordinates repair and
    rehabilitation work in the public right of way with other agencies.
    The work can involve street paving, sewer work, storm drain work and
    other projects. The coordination is done regularly with EBMUD, PG&E,
    ATT, Comcast, and other agencies to determine if they have planned
    work in the same area in the future. Berkeley also imposes a five
    year moratorium to not have work that requires pavement cuts after a
    street has been rehabilitated. All of these efforts help to ensure
    that construction work in one area is coordinated and that impacts
    to service and the public is minimized.

    Berkeley has been conducting studies to expand broadband internet
    service to more parts of Berkeley and is preparing a Broadband
    Infrastructure Master Plan. Many other cities have similar goals.
    One issue that many cities are addressing is whether to require the
    installation of conduits for telecom cables whenever other utility
    work is constructed. The purpose to expand internet service in
    cities and to minimize the cost and impacts of installing conduits
    separately. This is often called a "one dig" or "dig once" policy.

    The Vision 2050 task force recommends the adoption of a One Dig
    policy to formalize the coordination being done and to facilitate
    the expansion of internet service in the City. The policy should
    include the following.

-   Define the purpose and outcome objectives of having a One Dig policy

-   Define the infrastructure systems that will be involved with the
    policy

-   Define the agencies where coordination is required

-   Define the part of the organization responsible for the program

-   Define the reporting and oversight requirements

**Right-of-Way Management and Financing Policy**

The City must consider the 800 acres and 200 miles of city right-of-way
as a holistic asset that must be managed comprehensively over 30 years.
Key goals of the policy include the following:

**[Management]{.underline}**

The city's Transportation Division should be expanded into the
Right-of-Way Bureau and be responsible for all the coordination of all
aspects of the public right-of-way (i.e., construction coordination with
utilities, street openings, etc.) and primary jurisdiction over all
aspects of the ground plane (traffic management, curb management, green
infrastructure, sidewalk repair, and street pavement). A key need is for
a 3D map of all the utilities in the city right-of-way, which does not
currently exist. The Bureau should make this an essential and required
baseline project. Other city divisions and services (sewer, etc.) will
be treated by the Bureau in the same manner as the city currently
coordinates with private utilities.

**[Financing]{.underline}**

The Right-of-Way Bureau must become an enterprise department with
dedicated funding sources. These sources should fully fund the required
pavement program, sidewalk repair program, green infrastructure,
implementation of the bicycle and pedestrian plans, as well as the
on-going coordination efforts (requiring more staff). In addition to the
subventions from the State and the county sales tax, (about \$5 million
annually), the city should do the following with city-controlled
revenue:

-   Redirect two-thirds of the utility users fees (about \$10 million
    annually) to the Right-of-Way Enterprise Fund.

-   Redirect all of the parking meter revenue and the parking fines
    (about \$16 million annually) into the Right-of-Way Enterprise Fund.

-   Merge and reauthorize the separate street-lighting, stormwater,
    green infrastructure and sewer funding programs into one fund,
    specifically authorizing the use of these funds for associated
    projects within the public right-of-way.

-   Ad Valorem Tax: Berkeley has an assessed valuation of about \$20
    billion. This generates about \$200 million in 1% tax revenue, of
    which Berkeley receives 32.57%%, or about \$65 million annually. Up
    to 10% of the ad valorem revenues (initially about \$6.5 million
    annually) should be allocated to the Right-of-Way Enterprise Fund.

In addition, the city should also institute the following new taxes to
prepare for the gradual decline of the fuel tax and the likely increase
in shared-ride vehicles:

-   A TNC tax, patterned on San Francisco's proposed tax of 3.26% on
    regular single-passenger trips and 1.5% on shared rides. Trips made
    by fully electric vehicles will be tax-free for the first two years,
    and then gradually increasing to the full rate within five
    additional years.

-   A trip charge on all vehicles operating on city streets when TNC
    rates increase to 45%, replacing the TNC charge. An additional curb
    access charge for TNCs when they drop passengers on curbs on city
    streets.

-   Based on San Francisco's TNC calculations, the Berkeley tax could
    generate about \$5 million annually. These funds would be allocated
    to the Right-of-Way Enterprise Fund.

-   Street Damage Restoration Fees -- Los Angeles and other cities levy
    a street damage fee on local utilities for the pavement damage
    caused by underground utilities who do not adequately patch the
    street after projects. Based on Los Angeles calculations, in
    Berkeley this fee could provide an additional \$3 million annually
    into the Right-of-Way Enterprise Fund (this fee may be substantially
    reduced if the city coordinates paving and other projects well).

**Planning for the Future**

It is often said that the largest influence on a project are the
decisions made during planning. Planning is a process to consider the
community needs, the options to provide the project, the cost and
schedule implications, and other factors. The City excels in planning in
many departments. The following are recommendations to add to the
planning work being done.

**Develop an Asset Management Program**

Currently, the City has three modest Asset Management Programs for
vehicle maintenance & replacement, building maintenance and
computer/servers which total about \$19 million. Since these programs
represent a small fraction of the total infrastructure assets, we make
the following recommendations.

We recommend that an Asset Management Program (AMP) be developed to
properly maintain Berkeley's infrastructure and to forecast the future
improvement needs. The background on the concept is discussed in the
policy recommendations above.

We previously mentioned that much of the City's infrastructure systems
are 100 years old and have deteriorated. We can't change that, but we
can change the future. An AMP is a forward looking process. It forecasts
maintenance needs to keep systems in proper working order and predicts
the timing to perform repairs or replacement. It also forecasts the
costs, which helps with budgeting and rate setting.

Components of an AMP include:

[Summary of recommendations]{.underline}:

1.  Conduct research to understand the concept and benefits of asset
    management.

2.  Evaluate the organizational structure, staffing requirements, and
    budget to develop an asset management program.

3.  Prepare an Asset Management Plan.

    **Move to Integrated and Adaptive Planning**

    The planning and implementation of infrastructure projects typically
    involves the Planning, Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and
    Budget and Finance Departments. It appears to us that some
    departments have planning capability while others do not. Some
    departments operate according to functional programs. Our experience
    is that planning is a separate discipline that requires specialized
    training, tools, and experience. We recommend that each department
    review its organizational structure and evaluate ways to have a
    planning capability.

    Once planning capability is in place, we recommend that the planning
    be integrated across City departments. There are different ways to
    do this and the following is one suggestion.

-   Organize an oversight committee of department heads or their
    designees to review and ensure integration of planning

-   Hold quarterly oversight review meetings

-   Use an adaptive planning process

The new era of urban planning will have to contend with changes in the
environments that have seemed relatively stable in the past. With all
the things we've planned in the past -- road systems, sewer systems, new
towns, and new airports, etc. \-- we haven't planned for an environment
that is changing so much that it will require us to adapt.

"Adaptation" refers to altering our systems and structures to adjust to
permanent changes. Resilience refers to altering systems and structures
so that we can recover more quickly from temporary events. Both
resilience and adaptation will be needed in a changing climate, because
we will experience many of the gradual, permanent trends that we now
face as a series of events (for example, extra high tides, or extra hot
days). We will also continue to grapple with the risk of major
earthquake events, which will require an ability to recover quickly. But
adaptation is a special planning problem because it's new, and it will
require strategic investments by multiple generations of Berkeley
citizens in order to succeed.

The adaptation pathways approach is to array options against a future
trend that is known, although the magnitude of that trend is unknown for
any given year (as with sea level rise, for example). This planning
method is best for situations where there is a known trend and
direction, but the timing of the trend is uncertain. For example, we
know that sea levels are rising, and that they will continue to rise
until they reach at least 10 feet above present levels. But we don't
know what the relative sea level rise will be in any given year. We also
know that both the likelihood and intensity of fires are increasing in
California as a result of drying vegetation, but we don't know when the
Berkeley Hills will burn.

The adaptation pathways approach would require us to lay out the
different things we can do to reduce our losses and maintain our
resources over a period of time, and identify sequences of things we can
do as the environmental changes occur. Each sequence or "pathway" can be
compared to the others in terms of costs and benefits, allowing planners
to choose the one that maintains the most flexibility while conserving
the value of key assets over time.

As noted in the California SGC infrastructure planning guidance (CSIWG
2018), local governments need to track these environmental trends for at
least two critical reasons. Berkeley should use tools like network
diagrams and predicted climate trends to plan and communicate adaptation
pathways that will avoid wasting public funds on assets that will be
unsustainable. These adaptation pathways should be used to develop and
critique existing Local Hazard Management Plans (LHMPs), plans to
protect public health, watershed and street tree plans, park plans,
capital planning for sewers, road maintenance plans, revenue
expectations for coastal facilities, and water supply system capital
planning.

[Summary of recommendations]{.underline}:

1.  Review and develop planning capability in the departments involved
    with infrastructure management

2.  Develop an organizational structure, such as an oversight committee,
    to integrate planning across City departments

3.  Use adaptive planning processes

**Prepare Infrastructure Master Plans**

Whether projects are in the CIP or need further studies to be in the
CIP, we recommend preparing infrastructure master plans. Master Planning
is a process to develop long term plans for infrastructure systems. The
process incorporates the following components:

-   Evaluate the condition of the infrastructure assets and their
    remaining useful life.

-   Evaluate the drivers that will affect the future use of the systems,
    including regulatory requirements, climate change conditions,
    technology advancements, and other factors.

-   Evaluate alternatives for making the improvements.

-   Develop a plan for the improvements, including the priority,
    schedule and funding requirements.

    A Master Plan should be prepared for each infrastructure system. The
    Plan should project infrastructure needs for 20 or more years and
    the Plan should be updated on an approximate 5 year schedule.

    [Summary of recommendations]{.underline}:

    1.  Staff to review the status of existing infrastructure planning
        and to develop a program to prepare the needed infrastructure
        master plans.

    2.  Staff to prepare a process, criteria, and schedule to prepare
        the infrastructure master plans. The plans shall be updated on a
        regular schedule as required, such as every 5 years.

    3.  The master plans shall be the primary resource for input to the

**Finance for the Future**

City of Berkeley has \$851 million of Capital Assets^1^ of which 44%
have exceeded ~~it~~ their useful lifespans.

City currently spends only about \$34 million/year on capital and
maintenance needs. At this level of funding, Berkeley's infrastructure
is deteriorating faster than it is being repaired/replaced and
construction cost escalation (\~5%/yr) is significantly increasing
replacement costs. For example, currently, the City spends \$1.3
million/year maintaining storm drains. After five years, the unfunded
liability for the storm drain system is projected to increase from \$241
million to \$259 million.

-   To modernize its old decaying physical structures with resilient,
    durable, and climate-smart infrastructure will require substantial
    investments.

-   Does Berkeley have the financial resources to modernize its old
    decaying physical structures that provide vital services with a
    climate-smart infrastructure that will be resilient, technically
    advanced, and durable?

height="3.3541666666666665in"}Berkeley's finances are in good shape. In
the last decade and a half, General Fund revenues have increased from
\$108 to \$198 Million, or \~90%, as shown in Fig. 1. The Total City
Budget, which was \$446 million in FY2017 has increased by a similar
percentage. Revenues are exceeding expenses and the City's Investment
Portfolio, which holds unspent funds, has increased by 300%.

Capital expenditures are typically funded through a combination of debt
financing (pay-as-you use) and cash (pay-as-you-go). Paying in cash
avoids the cost of interest payments, but requires the City to
accumulate sufficient cash to fund the project, while construction costs
escalate. Using debt to finance capital projects, incurs interest
expense, but allows the project to start earlier avoiding escalation
costs. Finally, there is the option of using both cash and debt to
finance infrastructure as the City did with the Center Street Parking
Garage project.

**GO Bonds**

General Obligation Bonds (GO) are backed by the "full faith and credit"
of the issuer. Typically, GO bonds are based on the assessed value of
the property within the jurisdiction, and require voter approval by a
two-thirds majority.

The cost of borrowing capital funds depends on the City's credit rating.
In FY2018 the Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD), which has annual
revenues of \~\$175 million, has borrowed \$275 million and has received
a credit rating on its GO bond debt from Standard & Poor of AA+. The COB
Berkeley, which has annual revenues of \~\$415 million, has borrowed
\$91 million, and also has a credit rating of AA+.

*If the COB increased its GO debt/revenue ratio to match BUSD's, [the
COB could issue several hundred million of additional debt]{.underline}
and presumably keeps it AA+ rating.*

**Future GO Bond Debt Capacity**

How much debt that a municipality can issue depends of the total
assessed value of property in the City. Over the last quarter century,
Fig 14 shows that the total assessed value of property in Berkeley has
increased from \$4.7 billion to \$20 billion, or over 300%.

![](./images/media/image27.wmf){width="5.4375in" height="3.125in"}

> Fig. 14 shows the total assessed property values for the FYs 1992 --
> 2017.

If property values continue to increase at a similar rate over the next
30 years, the total value of Berkeley property could be three times
larger in 2050 than in 2018. This means that Berkeley could issue three
times as much debt than currently outstanding, without raising its
debt-service-tax-rate, if interest rates remain constant. Furthermore,
as old bonds are paid off as shown in the right-hand portion of Fig. 14,
there is an opportunity to issue additional debt, without raising the
debt-service-tax rate.

**Revenue Bonds**

Revenue bonds are defined as municipal bonds that finance projects that
have a revenue stream to support them. The income generated by the
revenue stream pays the interest and principal on the bonds. Recently,
the City of Berkeley issued a \$34 million revenue bond backed by
Parking Meter revenue with a coverage ratio of 2.55. See Fig. 15.

In contrast to Berkeley, which issues mostly GO-bonds, EBMUD issues all
of its debt as revenue bonds. With a revenue stream of \~\$100 million,
EBMUD's Wastewater (WW) system supports \~\$400 million in bond debt,
while maintaining a AAA bond rating from Standard & Poors.

Berkeley has a number of Enterprise Funds that provide services that
generate revenue streams (\~\$100 million) comparable to EBMUD's WW
system. If the cash generated by all of the COB's Enterprise funds could
generate a similar coverage ratio to the Center Street Garage, then
Berkeley may be able to carry \~\$350 million in revenue bond debt,
compared to the current \$60 million.

Fig. 15 shows a comparison of the revenues and bond debt for the COB and
EBMUD's WW system.

**Major Maintenance and Annual Capital Needs**

The majority of the San Francisco's ongoing annual capital needs are
funded with General Fund dollars. These are typically smaller
investments to maintain facilities and infrastructure in a good state.
The two largest categories are Street Resurfacing and Facility Renewal.

![](./images/media/image29.jpeg){width="5.132638888888889in"
height="3.2180555555555554in"}Fig. 16 San Francisco's Capital Plan
General Fund Debt Program: FYs2017-27.

As Fig. 4 shows, SF dedicates 3.25% of GF revenues to its Pay-As-You-Go
Program. Over time as the GF increases, the capital contributions
increase, which allows staff to plan on a 10-year timescale. Berkeley
has a similar program that assigns the "excess revenue" from the
Transfer Tax over \$12.5 Million to its Capital Improvement Fund.
Because the Transfer Tax is volatile, long range planning is difficult.

**Unfunded Liabilities and the General Fund Surpluses**

The City's two major unfunded liabilities are tied to infrastructure,
\$882 million, and benefits, \$665 million.

In response to the \$665 million benefits unfunded liability, in the
City plans to dramatically increase its spending on benefits to almost
\$116 million in 2020.

To adequately address the \$882 million in infrastructure unfunded
liabilities, the City needs to double its projected spending from \$33
million to \$66 million in 2020. Some possible sources of this new
funding are:

-   Develop a 10-Year Capital Funding Plan & Major Project Queue.

-   Increase capital funding from General Fund

    -   Lower the one-time revenue cap from \$12.5 million to \$8.5
        million which would provide an increase in Capital funding of
        \$4 million annually.

    -   Replace the Transfer Tax funding of capital/maintenance with a
        5% tax of Total GF revenue.

-   Assigning up to 50% of the annual salary savings to fund capital and
    maintenance needs.

-   Designate "unclaimed" Seismic/Resilience Rebates to an
    Infrastructure Reserve Fund.

-   Designate GF surpluses to the two major City Unfunded Liabilities --
    split 50/50.

-   Put a measure on the 2022 ballot to issue a new infrastructure bond.

Recently, Berkeley voters have demostrated that they strong support
increasing infrastrucutre spending, by approving \$130 million of
General Obligation bonds (Measure M & T1) by overwhelming margins. To
better align its priorities with the mandate from the voters, the City
needs to dedicate more of its existing revenue streams to address this
major unfunded liability. Failure to provide funding to maintain and
modernize existing infrastructure will greatly increase the future cost
due inflation and the increase in construction costs, which is currently
running at 5% per annum.

**New Development as a Source of Infrastructure Funding** During the
next quarter century, new development will continue across the City. All
of these developments increase the city's tax base, but some may lead to
the need for infrastructure upgrades.

A key tool used in San Francisco was the imposition of a Community
Services District only for upzoned properties and only imposed on the
increment of additional density granted. As an example, if the city were
to provide further upzoning in downtown or in the southside, that
additional development envelope would be allowed only if the property
owners agreed to create a districtwide Community Services District. The
CSD could then fund additional infrastructure needs or other public
benefits to accrued to the district -- these can include green
infrastructure, wider sidewalks, better streetlights, or even new parks.
In addition, the district can fund the maintenance of some of these
assets, providing a source of both capital and operating funds. The CSD
requires a study and nexus of benefits to the district and creates a
rate (based on the ad valorem value) of the development subject to the
tax.

Other funding tools include a financing successor to redevelopment --
the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District. In this district, tax
increment from some of the taxing agencies is pledged to the district,
which then issues bonds for infrastructure improvements. Berkeley could
pledge its own tax increments under this arrangement to provide another
financing mechanism.

**Hazards of Greatest Concern**

**[Earthquake]{.underline}**

We do not know when the next major earthquake will strike Berkeley. The
United States Geological Survey states that there is a 72% probability
of one or more M 6.7 or greater earthquakes from 2014 to 2043 in the San
Francisco Bay Region. There is a 33% chance that a 6.7 or greater will
occur on the Hayward fault system between 2014 and 2043. This means that
many Berkeley residents are likely to experience a severe earthquake in
their lifetime.

A catastrophic earthquake on the Hayward Fault would cause severe and
violent shaking and three types of ground failure in Berkeley. Surface
fault rupture could occur in the Berkeley hills along the fault,
damaging utilities and gas lines that cross the fault. Landslides are
expected in the Berkeley hills during the next earthquake, particularly
if the earthquake occurs during the rainy winter months. Landslide
movement could range from a few inches to tens of feet. Ground surface
displacements as small as a few inches are enough to break typical
foundations. Liquefaction is very likely in the westernmost parts of the
city and could occur in much of the Berkeley flats. Liquefaction can
destroy pavements and dislodge foundations.

Shaking and ground failure is likely to create impacts that ignite
post-earthquake fires. Firefighting will be simultaneously challenged
due to broken water mains and damage to electrical, transportation, and
communication infrastructure.

In a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on the Hayward Fault, the City estimates
that over 600 buildings in Berkeley will be completely destroyed and
over 20,000 more will be damaged. One thousand to 4,000 families may
need temporary shelter. Depending on the disaster scenario, one hundred
people could be killed in Berkeley alone, and many more would be
injured. Commercial buildings, utilities, and public roads will be
disabled or destroyed. This plan estimates that building damage in
Berkeley alone could exceed \$2 billion, out of a multi-billion dollar
regional loss, with losses to business activities and infrastructure
adding to this figure.

Low-income housing units are expected to be damaged at a higher rate
than other residences. Other types of housing, such as condominiums, may
replace them when land owners rebuild. This could lead to profound
demographic shifts in Berkeley.

**[Wildland-Urban Interface Fire]{.underline}**

Berkeley is vulnerable to a wind-driven fire starting along the city's
eastern border. The fire risk facing the people and properties in the
eastern hills is compounded by the area's mountainous topography,
limited water supply, minimal access and egress routes, and location,
overlaid upon the Hayward Fault. Berkeley's flatlands are also exposed
to a fire that spreads west from the hills. The flatlands are
densely-covered with old wooden buildings housing low-income and
vulnerable populations, including isolated seniors, people with
disabilities, and students.

The high risk of wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire in Berkeley was
clearly demonstrated in the

1991 Tunnel Fire, which destroyed 62 homes in Berkeley and more than
3,000 in Oakland. In 1923, an even more devastating fire burned through
Berkeley. It began in the open lands of Wildcat Canyon to the northeast
and, swept by a hot September wind, penetrated residential north
Berkeley and destroyed nearly 600 structures, including homes,
apartments, fraternities and sororities, a church, a fire station and a
library. The fire burned downhill all the way to Shattuck

Avenue in central Berkeley.

If a fire occurred today that burned the same area, the loss to
structures would be in the billions of dollars. Destruction of contents
in all of the homes and businesses burned would add hundreds of millions
of dollars to fire losses. Efforts to stabilize hillsides after the fire
to prevent massive landslides would also add costs. Depending on the
speed of the fire spread, lives of Berkeley residents could also be
lost. Many established small businesses, homes, and multi-family
apartment buildings, particularly student housing, would be completely
destroyed, changing the character of Berkeley forever.

**[Catastrophic Reserve]{.underline}**

Berkeley Catastrophic Reserve was established to sustain General Fund
Operations in the case of a public emergency such as a natural disaster.
Currently, this reserve fund totals \$13 million. Since the City's
monthly expenditures are \~\$39 million, \$13 million is clearly
inadequate to fund the City's response to a major earthquake or
wildfire.

The City does have a large pool of liquid funds in its Investment
Portfolio, which as of December 31, 2018 contained at \$446 million in
Total Cash and Investments. Several employee trust funds contain \~\$45
million and the balance of \$401 million consists of unspent fund
balances, bond proceeds, additional reserves, and operating cash. While
\~\$80 million originated from the General Fund and presumably could be
redirected to funding the City's emergency response to a major disaster,
the \$320 million balance originated from the City's numerous other
funds which have legal strictures on allowable expenditures.

To secure more adequate liquid funds to address a major disaster, we
recommend that the City

-   Consider designating its Investment Portfolio as a Major Disaster
    Reserve.

**Implement for the Future**

When the proper approvals have been made, Berkeley will embark on a
large and long-term process to plan, design, build, and maintain
improvements to our infrastructure. This will go far beyond the
magnitude of our current CIP and of the Measure T1 program. How to
implement to program will require careful evaluation and discussions.
The following suggestions are provided to get the discussion started.

**Use a Program Approach**

With an infrastructure program that will approach \$1 billion, it will
be necessary to prioritize the work in phases. Phase 1 is the current
Measure T1 program. Subsequent phases will depend on the priority of the
work, whether planning has been started, community input, and the
overall ability to implement the work. Table 5 is a suggested five phase
program.

A Program Plan should be written and available to City staff and the
community.

**Develop organizational capacity and structure**

Capital infrastructure work is primarily carried out by the Planning,
Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and Budget and Finance departments.
The work involves planners, engineers, construction managers,
procurement specialists, contracts, and other people. All of these
capabilities are in place to carry out the City's CIP. When the Measure
T1 program was initiated, a special program team was organized. They
have dedicated staff and utilize support from other parts of the City.

The proposed infrastructure program is much larger than can be handled
by the current staff or organization. We suggest that the City consider
the following topics.

-   **Organizational structure** -- We recommend that an infrastructure
    program department be created in the City's organization. This would
    be separate from the day-to-day operations of public works and parks
    and recreation. There should be core competencies in the department,
    such as planning, design, construction management, and schedule and
    cost management. Other departments, such as procurement, legal,
    field operations, etc. shall provide support. To ensure that work is
    coordinated throughout the City, there should be a management
    oversight committee.

-   **Staff capabilities** -- We recommend that additional staff be
    hired. The number of staff and their expertise needs further
    evaluation. Staff will be required in the current public works and
    parks and recreation departments to prepare master plans and to
    create an asset management program. Staff will be required in the
    new infrastructure program department.

-   **Use of consultants** -- We recommend that the program team be a
    blend of City staff and consultants. It is a cost-effective way to
    retain knowledge while gaining expertise. This blended approach has
    been used effectively in San Francisco, San Jose, and other major
    infrastructure programs.

    **Develop program management tools and processes**

    We recommend that a Program Plan be written. The Plan should include
    the following:

<!-- -->

-   Outcome objectives

-   Breakdown structure of work activities

-   Project team and responsibilities

-   Cost and schedule tracking

-   Change management and approval process

-   Reporting

To effectively carry out the program, the project team will need many
tools, including the following.

-   A cost accounting system that will be able to track and report on
    labor, materials, and consultant costs according to a work breakdown
    structure.

-   A website to communicate with the public.

-   Document management

-   Risk management

-   Cost estimating

-   Scheduling

-   Procurement

    **Utilize independent oversight and reporting**

We talk a lot about having transparency and accountability with City
programs and good way to ensure that is to have independent oversight
and reporting. The concept is to appoint a citizen's oversight committee
comprised of people with relevant experience. The committee would meet
quarterly and prepare an annual report of progress compared to the
Program Plan. The concept has been used effectively by the Berkeley
Unified School District and other agencies in the Bay Area.

**Exciting Projects Ahead**

The environmental trends and technology advances are opportunities to
create exciting projects for our future. How will these apply to
Berkeley? The following suggests new solutions to old problems.

The following illustrates how the new solutions can be applied.

-   **Develop micro-grids** \-- Develop a micro-grid network connecting
    both public and private facilities. In order to accommodate more
    distributed renewable generation, and to foster more resilience and
    reliability, the City's electricity distribution grid infrastructure
    will need to identify and increase "hosting capacity" for
    distributed energy resources and allow for two-way flows of energy.

-   **Safe and sustainable transportation** \-- The City has direct
    control over its vehicle fleets, including emergency services
    vehicles and charging facilities on Municipal Property. Through a
    "safe streets" lens and its plan implementation (Paving Plan, BeST
    Plan, Vision Zero, etc.) it can switch to more durable permeable
    pavement, add protected bicycle and pedestrian pathways, create more
    public transportation hubs and services and generally deprioritize
    private traffic and parking.

-   **Electrify buildings** \-- Along with transportation, buildings
    account for the bulk of energy consumption in Berkeley, historically
    both gas and electricity. Vision 2050 requires that all building
    loads be electrified. These electrified buildings have the potential
    to provide critical services to the distribution system, including
    demand response, peak load shifting and management, and even voltage
    and frequency regulation. Most of these opportunities will be
    determined at the state or market level by the CPUC and utility
    providers, but the actual conversion of the building systems and
    end-uses are subject to City oversight and influence.

> Title 24 already encourages conversion to heat pump technology for
> water heating and HVAC, as well as encouraging efficient appliances,
> lighting and building envelope requirements. Berkeley should consider
> additional incentives or streamlining to encourage more rapid
> adoption.
>
> Title 24 also requires solar on all new construction and major
> retrofits. Berkeley can further ensure that all buildings have
> sufficient and appropriate solar generation through its zoning and
> permitting ordinances and through targeted incentives, tax exemptions
> and application streamlining.

-   **Use electric vehicles** \-- To meet climate targets by 2050,
    personal transport will need to be electrified - move off of fuel to
    decarbonized electricity. Much of the capital investment will be
    market driven as consumers decide to purchase or procure electric
    vehicles. From an Energy Services perspective, this shift requires
    that multiple charging modes are available to facilitate efficient
    "fueling" of the vehicles. In addition, vehicle fleets and services,
    like buses, TNCs, police, fire and emergency vehicles subject to
    approval by the City must be converted to all-electric in a timely
    and orderly manner.

> City plans must identify and develop locations for publicly accessible
> grid-connected and powered Level I, Level II and DC-fast charge
> facilities, with sufficient geographic diversity and capacity to serve
> Berkeley residents regardless of income or neighborhood. This means
> that curbside charging may be necessary in many dense multifamily
> neighborhoods. Heavy duty charging facilities for public transit and
> city fleets, as well as facilities for electric bikes, scooters and
> other mobility options must be incorporated into planning. This will
> require enhanced permitting guidelines, standards and possibly
> incentives, as well as allowances for new business models.
>
> Prioritize safe access for pedestrians, bikers, low cost widely
> available zero carbon public transit fleets, EV charging, and
> on-demand services for seniors and youth. The City must continue to
> encourage and support (for example, through streamlined permitting
> processes) at-home vehicle charging. A clarified policy on
> single-family homes without access to off-street parking must be
> developed so that charging stanchions and plugs can be properly and
> safely installed at or near the public-right-of-way. Incentives will
> also play a part, particularly for disadvantaged communities in
> Berkeley. Leveraging its permitting authority, the City can encourage
> more widespread deployment of both public and private charging
> infrastructure, not just for cars, but for buses, bikes and scooters
> as well. Tapping into the use of vehicle transponders and street
> sensors is also recommended.

-   **Use green infrastructure** \-- Integrate multi-benefit Green
    Infrastructure as an element in all Public Works projects. As noted,
    Green Infrastructure is one of the best examples of resilience in
    practice. Move beyond compliance in implementation of the Green
    Infrastructure Plan.

-   **Dig once**\-- Perform all street rehabilitation in coordination
    with utility, sewer, water runoff, and undergrounding projects. Use
    the underlying infrastructure condition as a factor in paving
    project selection and prioritization.

-   **Consider material life cycle** \-- Incorporate material life cycle
    with waste reduction and material reuse. Utilize recycling as a last
    resort in all project specifications. Address external benefits and
    costs in project design.

<!-- -->

-   **Diversify water supply** \-- Innovate to diversify Berkeley's
    water supply. Examine the use of groundwater for landscape or backup
    water supply. Participate in the EBMUD/Hayward Sustainable
    Groundwater Plan development process. Investments in cisterns
    installed in street storm water management projects should include
    water retention and use. Work with EBMUD and UCB to bring reclaimed
    water distribution to Berkeley.

-   **Restore Nature as infrastructure** -- Nature can be the first line
    of defense integrated into engineered solutions within the urban
    landscape. Natural systems can provide protection, adaptation and
    mitigation to climate impacts. In addition to the recommendations in
    the Resilience Strategy, the City must increase tree canopy in the
    mid and low lands to address air quality, heat impacts and quality
    of life as we continue to build. Trees and marshes should be
    factored into carbon capture calculations as we move to 2045 carbon
    neutrality. Use of native trees and plants will improve urban
    habitat. Plantings along transportation corridors in coordination
    with adjacent cities will ensure migration paths for birds and
    pollinators. As elements of all Marina projects, develop, enhance
    and continue restoration of marshland along the Bayfront to
    stabilize the shoreline against sea level rise, capture sediment
    runoff and provide habitat. Marsh vegetation is the most effective
    vegetative carbon sequestration planting.

<!-- -->

-   **Preserve permeability** \-- Incorporate climate impacts into all
    public infrastructure projects. With increasing private property
    development much of the City's remaining permeability is being paved
    over with hardscape and buildings. An assessment of the current
    level of impermeability should be made to ensure that the storm
    water infiltration levels do not further degrade with continued
    development. To maintain current levels of infiltration, the City
    should ensure that equivalent land areas within the public commons
    are made permeable to offset all private property development of
    impermeable surfaces and specific GI. Future GI and Watershed
    Management Plans should move the City to restoration of infiltration
    in keeping with future Sustainable Groundwater Management Plans.

[^1]: SB 100 (de León) was signed by the Governor in September, 2018. It
    mandates 60% renewable energy for electricity generation by 2030 and
    100% carbon free by 2045, which could include nuclear, large hydro
    and other clean energy technologies. It does not speak to the
    penetration of distributed technologies or specifically address
    local resilience.
