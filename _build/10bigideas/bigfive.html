AFFORDABLE HOUSING. Ensure that at least 50% of all new housing units
produced along the Adeline Corridor over the next 20 years are income-restricted
housing affordable at a range of income levels including for the lowest income and
highest need households. While it is not possible to perfectly predict the number
of new housing units that will be built in the area, based on an analysis of available
vacant and underutilized sites, this Plan projects that a total of 1,450 new housing
units could be built in the corridor over the next 20 years. At least half of this total
– 725 units – is the target for affordable units for very low-, low-, and moderateincome households. (Chapter 1 under “Regulatory Framework” and the Draft
Environmental Impact Report, Chapter 2 Project Description provide a more
detailed description of the “buildout projection” through 2040.) The deepest levels
of affordability will be provided on public land, including the Ashby BART Station
parking lots. Elsewhere, new zoning standards will create incentives to include
substantial numbers of affordable units within market rate projects. See Chapters
3 and 4 of this Plan for more information.
ASHBY BART STATION. Redevelop the Ashby BART Station Area as a vibrant
neighborhood center with high-density mixed-use development, structured
parking (including some replacement parking for BART riders), ground floor
commercial and civic uses, and new public space. The BART development should
incorporate green construction and become a model for sustainable transitoriented development. It should unify both sides of Adeline Street, and provide
public space for community gatherings, special events, and civic celebrations. [See
Chapters 3, 4 and 7 of this Plan for more information].</p>
