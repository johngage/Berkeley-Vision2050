<h2 id="Berkeley-2050-Vision-materials">Berkeley 2050 Vision materials<a class="anchor-link" href="#Berkeley-2050-Vision-materials"> </a></h2><p>Most recent update: <strong>Thursday, September 19, 2019</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on draft document prepared August 1, 2019; revised draft, September 1, 2019. In process of updating initial draft.</li>
<li>Working on building parallel texts,or a parallel TOC, to allow the original draft to remain unchanged, while displaying edits and suggestions in a parallel version.</li>
<li><p>The Table of Contents reflects the parallel nature of this document: for each Task Force chapter, I'm building a companion chapter exploring each data source, each measurement, each quantitative analysis and extrapolation, utilizing interactive Jupyter notebooks to acquire and visualize the data. The central thread leads through the chapters of the Taskforce document; the secondary thread in the TOC leads through the companion chapters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>### Note for all readers:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a preliminary working draft. Please don't panic.</p>
<p>The original Draft Report Sections track the work of the Vision2050 Steering Committee. The parallel Enhanced Sections add links to data sources and Jupyter Notebooks, for data analysis.</p>
<p>These pages change daily, to link in new data sources, new City documents, and new analyses. If you revisit, refresh the page:
<code>Windows — Hold down Ctrl and press R.</code>
<code>Mac — Hold down ⌘ Command and press R.</code></p>
<p>As a new practice in urban planning, we are building a working plan in an interactive book containing the actual calculations that lie behind the analysis, so you can see how each number is derived from data.   <em>JupyterBooks</em> include <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>, introduced at UCBerkeley to support all Data Science courses, which allow direct access to all data sources and, more importantly, to all computations and analyses based on that data.</p>
<p>Our goal is open data, open analysis, open discussion, open decision making. Democracy relies upon common facts and agreed-upon common analysis of those facts.</p>

<p>Not all the images and tables are in this version, yet. In progress.</p>
<p>A link below goes to Ray Yep's draft of August 1, 2019. As content is added to Section 6 and 7, and revisions occur, I'll update.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="03toc/toc.html">Table of Contents</a>  in the left sidebar to navigate the chapters. Note the button at the top to open or close the sidebar that shows the chapters.</p>
<p>I put this into a JupyterBook, to incorporate data science analytics,  real-time visualizations, and detailed maps incorporating the data.</p>
<p>Editorial suggestions and annotations are easier to share in the form of a published book than in Word documents or GoogleSheets. This book can run live Jupyter Notebooks, so the reader can pull in ever-changing data, and explore, analyze and visualize it in real-time.</p>
<p>The hope is to provide an open platform for the Berkeley community to freely explore data about our shared future.</p>

<a href="https://www.drawdown.org/">Paul Hawken: <em>Drawdown</em></a> and a set of his references: <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/references">Drawdown References</a></p>
<p>Linking Berkeley data sources to the Drawdown analysis will let us track how well we are doing in reducing global warming.</p>
<p>And note that our Taskforce recommendations for new financial tools to fund Berkeley infrastructure investment are tools for change as important as those cataloged in Paul's book.</p>
